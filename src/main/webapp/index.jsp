<h2>Hello comfort</h2>

<p>This is my NextWork web application working!</p>

<p>
  My ultimate goal as a Cloud Engineer is to build highly scalable, reliable, and secure cloud infrastructures that drive innovation and business efficiency. I am deeply committed to mastering core cloud concepts across AWS, including networking, compute, storage, identity and access management, and automation. I aim to design fault-tolerant systems that can handle modern workloads while maintaining strong compliance and security controls.
</p>

<p>
  In the short term, my focus is on earning the <strong>AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate</strong> and <strong>HashiCorp Terraform Associate</strong> certifications. These credentials will help me solidify my foundation in infrastructure-as-code, cloud architecture design, and best deployment practices. I also plan to enhance my skills in CI/CD automation using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and AWS CodePipeline.
</p>

<p>
  Over time, I aspire to take on advanced roles involving <em>DevOps integration</em>, <em>cloud security engineering</em>, and <em>system reliability</em>. I want to lead projects that modernize legacy systems, migrate workloads to the cloud, and create optimized environments using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and monitoring platforms such as CloudWatch and Datadog.
</p>

<p>
  Ultimately, my vision is to become a senior-level cloud solutions architect who not only builds efficient and resilient architectures but also mentors junior engineers, promotes automation, and contributes to a culture of continuous improvement and innovation.
